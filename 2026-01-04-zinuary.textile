Over the years, YouTube has dialed in its algorithm regarding my personal tastes. Most artsy, craftsy, DIY kinds of things tumble through my feed...and I _love_ it.

Occasionally, I will get an unexpected jolt of inspiration right when I need it, which is one of life's most sublime pleasures in my book.

Such was the case on New Year's Day, when I watched a vid by a gentleman named Stefan Halbuer where he shared his idea for _Zinuary_, a make-a-zine-in-a-month challenge.

Lots to love about all of this! I love that he opens it up to whoever wants to join, any and all types of creators. I really dig his illustration style<sup>_1_</sup> — that grungy sci-fi comic bookish feel is in my sweet spot! (His work reminded me a little of the King of drawn detail, "Geof Darrow"/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geof_Darrow/.)
