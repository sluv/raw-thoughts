We stand in a rushing river of stimuli these days. Images, words, and ideas move past us in a constant flow. Learning to scan has become a necessary skill. We’ve adapted to the current. We register shapes and flashes, react instinctively, and let them wash over us.

This isn’t a failure of attention. It’s survival.

As digital tools continue to accelerate the pace and volume of this flow, there is one thing that still has the power to slow us down, to warrant extended attention and pull us from our scanning gaze: human connection.

Handmade objects have a way of resisting the current. They don’t announce themselves loudly. They don’t demand immediate reaction. They wait.

A small book full of shared references. A cup with a delicate glaze in your favorite color. An embroidered version of a fantastical beast. These things don’t rush past us; they remain available. Patient. Open to return.

To make something by hand is to take a risk. It means allowing personal judgment — taste, preference, aesthetic — to become visible. Even the smallest object carries something of its maker: a choice, a hesitation, a way of seeing. Offered to someone else, it becomes more than simply a tangible thing, it becomes a gesture. An invitation.
This is how handmade work sidesteps the slickness of mere faddishness. It's not beholden to the river, but entangled with its human maker and what drove them to create it. Inspired by a laugh, born of a trip, discovered in a song. In a culture optimized for endless sameness, this kind of specificity feels quietly courageous.

To those seeking this type of human connection, handmade wins.

        I wrote this as an introduction to a larger project that was meant to become a self-published collection of essays. Upon closer inspection, I realized that I might be better served by simply blogging my thoughts, and leaving the culling/re-evaluating/refining tasks for later. This would preserve the spontaneity of my posts (and hopefully quiet my inner editor a bit), while still allowing me to document and revisit ideas that matter to me. Hence, this site!
